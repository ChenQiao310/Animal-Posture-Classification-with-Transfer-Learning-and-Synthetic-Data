# Animal-Posture-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-and-Synthetic-Data

This project proposes an Animal Posture Classification System leveraging transfer learning techniques and synthetic data. The core objective is to enhance animal behavior analysis, crucial for wildlife preservation, agricultural health, and pet care, by automating the classification of animal postures. Addressing the challenge of limited available datasets tailored for this purpose, our approach involves refining the ResNet50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) model, pre-trained on ImageNet, with annotated datasets. This project also explores other solutions like Manifold Mixup and the utilization of synthetic data generated by stable diffusion model to overcome data scarcity. This multifaceted strategy aims to yield a more accurate and efficient system for animal posture classification. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms models trained from scratch. Further improvements are achieved through the application of Manifold Mixup techniques and the integration of synthetic data.
